Authlogic::NilCryptoProvider (In version 5, Authlogic used SCrypt by default. As of version 6, there
is no default. We still recommend SCrypt. If you previously relied on
this default, then, in your User model (or equivalent), please set the
following:

    acts_as_authentic do |c|
      c.crypto_provider = ::Authlogic::CryptoProviders::SCrypt
    end

Furthermore, the authlogic gem no longer depends on the scrypt gem. In
your Gemfile, please add scrypt.

    gem "scrypt", "~> 3.0"

We have made this change in Authlogic 6 so that users of other crypto
providers no longer need to install the scrypt gem.
